## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a full stack developer based in Buenos Aires. I'm currently learning microservices and cloud, creating projects like this to practice. 
I'm a huge fan of literature and my first ever website was a bookstore page on my first coding camp in 2021. 
I'm a tech enthusiastic too, always ready for challenges and eager to dive into new technologies. Whether it's building sleek frontends, designing robust backends, or orchestrating services in the cloud, I enjoy every step of the development process. When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me reading a good book, exploring new coffee spots, or brainstorming ideas for my next project. Letâ€™s build something awesome together!
